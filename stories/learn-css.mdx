# Learn CSS

CSS stands for "Cascading Stylesheets". Some styles are applied by browser called as "user-agent" styles. These styles are applied by default and can be overridden by the styles we write. CSS is used to style the HTML elements and make the web pages look good.

### CSS Generic Syntax

CSS Rule:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

Add css file in html:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
HTML Selectors:
h1, p, li ..etc

Selecting two HTML selectors at a time
```css
h1, p {
  color:green;
}
```
Remove list bullets from html elements
```css
li{
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

### CSS Specificity Scoring

- **ID selector:** 100  
- **Class selector:** 10  
- **Element selector:** 1  

CSS rules are applied based on specificity and follow this hierarchy of precedence:  

```
Inline styles > ID selectors > Class + Element selectors > Class selectors > Element selectors
```

`If multiple rules have the same specificity, the rule that appears later in the stylesheet (cascading order) will be applied.`


We can combine more than one specificty like class + element or class + id and so on. Calculate specificity based on the total of all!Refrain from using `style` tag.


## How CSS works?

- Browser loads HTML which is received from network converts HTML into DOM (DOM is document in computer's memory).
- Browser fetches most resources that are linked to HTML document like video, images,CSS. 
- Browser parses CSS and based on css rules it attaches the rules to node of DOM (`render tree`) and then visual display of page is shown (painting)

```html
.box {
  width: 500px;
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
}
```

This makes sure old browser use 500px whereas new browser overrides with calc and understands calc. We do this so that
old browser who dont understand calc can still work

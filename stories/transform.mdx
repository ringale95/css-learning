Only transformable elements are transformed. Below are not transformed:
- Inline boxes ( multiple span within p)

API:

```
transform: none | transform-functions;
```

 <div class="box_t rotate">Rotate</div>
  <div class="box_t scale">Scale</div>
  <div class="box_t translate">Translate</div>
  <div class="box_t skew">Skew</div>

`Scaling/zooming animations are problematic for accessibility, as they are a common trigger for certain types of migraine. If you need to include such animations on your website, you should provide a control to allow users to turn off animations, preferably site-wide.`

```
transform: translate(30px, 20px);
```
Translate moves element 30px to right along X-axis and 20px down(along Y-axis) from current position.

The translate function does not affect the document flow, so it doesnâ€™t push other elements around; it only visually moves the element.

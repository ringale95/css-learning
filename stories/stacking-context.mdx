# Stacking context :

For overlapping elements, z-index, managing visual layering of content stacking context is important that determines how elements
are layered visually with higher stacking index appear infront of lower ones.

### When Does a Stacking Context Get Created?
- Root element
- positioned elements(fixed, relative)
- flex and grid items
- opacity
- transform
- perspective
- filter
- clip-path
- z-index

Imagine a table where we keep blocks one over other as per the numbering and if a table has a tray and blocks kept in a tray are 
separate from other blocks on table. Similarly every stacking context is independent and does not overlap with others

Here,
The table is the main stacking area.
Each tray creates its own stacking area (like a mini world).
Blocks in a tray can only stack within that tray, no matter how tall they are.

<div class="parent">
  <div class="child-a">Child A</div>
  <div class="child-b">Child B</div>
</div>

CSS Used
```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  background: lightblue;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}

.child-a {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
  background: orange;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.child-b {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 5;
  background: green;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin-top: -50px;
}
```

So here parent establish a new stacking context due to position and z-index. 
The child a and b are ordered by their z-index relative to each other within stacking context of parent.
